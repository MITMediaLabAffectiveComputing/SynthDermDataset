        <span style="font-weight:bold"><tt>SynthDerm</tt></span> (Figure 1) is a synthetically generated dataset inspired by the real-world characteristics of melanoma skin lesions in dermatology settings [1]. These characteristics include whether the lesion is <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">a</span>symmetrical, its <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">b</span>order is irregular or jagged, is unevenly <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">c</span>olored, has a <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">d</span>iameter more than 0.25 inches, or is <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">e</span>volving in size, shape, or color over time. These qualities are usually referred to as ABCDE of melanoma [2] (Figure 2). We generate <span style="font-weight:bold"><tt>SynthDerm</tt></span> algorithmically by varying several factors: skin tone, lesion shape, lesion size, lesion location (vertical and horizontal), and whether there are surgical markings present. We randomly assign one of the following to the lesion shape: round, asymmetrical, with jagged borders, or multi-colored (two different shades of colors overlaid with salt-and-pepper noise). For skin tone values, we simulate Fitzpatrick ratings [3]. Fitzpatrick scale is a commonly used approach to classify the skin by its reaction to sunlight exposure modulated by the density of melanin pigments in the skin. This rating has six values, where 1 represents skin that always burns (lowest melanin) and 6 represents skin that never burns in sunlight (highest melanin). For our synthetic generation, we consider six base skin tones that similarly resemble different amounts of melanin. We also add a small amount of random noise to the base color to add further variety. Overall, <span style="font-weight:bold"><tt>SynthDerm</tt></span> includes more than 2,600 images of size 64x64.
